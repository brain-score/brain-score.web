    The Brain-Score platform aims to yield strong computational models of the ventral stream.
    We enable researchers to quickly get a sense of how their model scores against standardized brain benchmarks on
    multiple dimensions and facilitate comparisons to other state-of-the-art models.
    At the same time, new brain data can quickly be tested against a wide range of models
    to determine how well existing models explain the data.

    Brain-Score is organized by the <a href="github.com/brain-score">Brain-Score team</a>
    in collaboration with researchers and labs worldwide.
    We are working towards an easy-to-use platform where
    a model can easily be submitted to yield its scores on a range of brain benchmarks and
    new benchmarks can be incorporated to challenge the models.

    This quantified approach lets us keep track of how close our models are to the brain
    on a range of experiments (data) using different evaluation techniques (metrics).
