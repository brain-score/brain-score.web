            What is the purpose of Brain-Score?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            The Brain-Score platform aims to yield strong computational models of the brain and mind. We enable
            researchers to quickly get a sense of the alignment of their model(s) to currently dozens of neural and
            behavioral measurements, and provide these models to experimentalists to prototype new experiments and make
            sense of biological data. We recommend reading the <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(20)30605-X">perspective paper</a>
            and the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/407007v1">technical paper</a> that outline both the
            ideas and the inner workings of how Brain-Score operates.

            What are all the numbers on the Brain-Score site?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            As of now on the leaderboard (Brain-Score), there are many scores that your model would obtain. These are
            sub-divided into neural and behavioral scores which themselves are further hierarchically organized. Each
            one of these is a set of benchmarks that tests how “brain-like” your model is to various cognitive and
            neural data – in essence, it is a measure of how similar the model is to the brain’s visual or language
            system. Models are also tested on “Engineering” benchmarks which do not include biological data but typically
            test against ground truth, often for a machine learning benchmark. These are often correlated to the brain and
            behavioral scores (e.g. more V1-like → more robust to image perturbations).

        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile question_text has-text-weight-bold no_top_header">
            What is a benchmark?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            A benchmark is composed of data, a metric, and an experimental protocol to test models. The data is
            typically primate (human or non-human) neural and/or behavioral data. When a model is run on a benchmark,
            the metric outputs a score of how well the model predictions match the data.
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile question_text has-text-weight-bold no_top_header">
            What is a metric?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            A metric scores how similar two sets of data are. Typically these two sets are model and primate
            measurements, but metrics are agnostic of the data source and can also be used to compare two
            primate measurements (e.g. for ceiling estimates).
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile question_text has-text-weight-bold no_top_header">
            What is a model?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            Specifically, "model" here refers to any computational model that implements the BrainModel
            (for Brain-Score Vision) or ArtificialSubject (for Brain-Score Language) API, which defines the interface
            that allows a conformant model to run on Brain-Score benchmarks.
            Note that Brain-Score is agnostic to the exact model family, e.g. this could be an artificial neural
            network or a hand-crafted predictor. As long as the model makes predictions that adhere to the API, it can
            be tested.
        </p>
         <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile question_text has-text-weight-bold no_top_header">
            What is a score?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            The scores that Brain-Score computes are a normalized value ranging from <span class="special_format">0.0</span>
            to <span class="special_format">1.0</span> . The score reflects how closely model predictions align with
            biological data, e.g. neural activity or behavior, as evaluated by each benchmark's metric.
            <span class="special_format">0</span>  means the model does not match the measurements at all
            and <span class="special_format">1</span>  means the model matches the measurements at ceiling level such
            that no more data can be explained due to noise in the signal (e.g. if the model obtains a score of
            <span class="special_format">0.8</span>  and the data ceiling is also <span class="special_format">0.8</span> ,
            the score output by this method should be <span class="special_format">1</span> ).

        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            You can submit new plugins to Brain-Score. A plugin can be a dataset, a metric, a benchmark, or a model.
            You can submit plugins directly on the website as a zip file or via a pull request on Github
            (zip file submissions will automatically be converted into a PR). The plugin directory has to contain at
            least two files: an <span class="special_format">__init__.py</span> which adds your data/metric/benchmark/model
            to the corresponding registry, and a <span class="special_format">test.py</span> file in which you can
            define tests to ensure your plugin works as expected. If your plugin requires third-party libraries, you can
            include a <span class="special_format">setup.py</span> or a<span class="special_format">requirements.txt</span> file.
            You can optionally add more files, e.g. to separate the detailed implementations.

            How do I submit a model?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            We have created two tutorials outlining how to submit a new Brain-Score plugin-  a
            (<a href="https://www.brain-score.org/tutorial/quickstart">Quickstart tutorial</a>)  and
            three (<a href="https://www.brain-score.org/tutorial/deepdive_1">Deep Dive tutorials</a>).
            The Quickstart tutorial outlines how to set up your local environment quickly and how to run the pipeline
            locally. The Deep Dive tutorials contain direction on how to submit plugins and even provide a template
            plugin file.

            What happens to a model after I submit it?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            A pull request is opened on the Brain-Score GitHub of whichever plugin type you submitted, either
            (<a href="https://github.com/brain-score/vision">vision</a> or <a href="https://github.com/brain-score/language">language</a>).
            If this pull request passes all of the Jenkins tests, the PR will be merged and the scoring of your plugin
            will begin. Once scored, the Brain-Score of your plugin will appear on the leaderboard as long as you didn't
            ask for your model's score to be private when submitting it.

        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile question_text has-text-weight-bold no_top_header">
            Am I able to keep my submissions private?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            While we do not currently support private code submissions -- at the moment, all submitted code is merged
            into our public GitHub repository -- this functionality is under development and anticipated to be available
            soon. An automated option for including private files with your submission is also planned; in the interim,
            please contact us with any files that need to remain private and we will upload them directly to our AWS S3.
            This is a good way to enable model testing on your data without releasing it if you wish to keep it private:
            Your data will not be publicly accessible but by submitting models, the community can still get a sense of
            model alignment.

            I submitted a model but don't see it in my profile. Why not?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            There are a variety of reasons that your model may not be showing up in your profile. The submission and
            scoring process can vary depending on server availability, so if you haven't received an email indicating
            an error, it's possible that tests or scoring are still running. As every successful submission should
            result in a pull request in the relevant GitHub repository
            (<a href="https://github.com/brain-score/vision">vision</a> or
            <a href="https://github.com/brain-score/language">language</a>), you can check to see if there is either an
            open or closed PR with your model name in the title, which can provide further information about the status
            of your submission. If you need assistance, you can either create a GitHub issue or reach out via Slack
            explaining your problem and someone in our developer community will assist you.

            I was looking at the code and I found an error in the code/docs/etc. How can I contribute?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            We welcome and encourage user participation in our code base! The easiest way to do so is to fork the
            repository (make a copy of the Brain-Score Github repository locally and/or in your own Github), make the
            necessary edits there, and submit a pull request (PR) to merge it into our master branch. We will then review
            and approve the PR, and after that it is merged into our code base.

            I really like Brain-Score, and I have some ideas that I would love to talk to someone about. How do I get in touch?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            The easiest way to get in touch with us is via our Slack channel. For bugs or feature requests, we encourage you to
            make an issue <a href="https://github.com/brain-score/vision/issues/new">here</a>, or send us an email!
            We will also be creating a mailing list soon, so stay tuned.

        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile question_text has-text-weight-bold no_top_header">
            Is there any reward for reaching the top overall Brain-Score? Or even a top score on the individual benchmarks?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            We sometimes run competitions (e.g. https://www.brainscoreworkshop.com/). A top Brain-Score result is
            also a great way to show the goodness of your model and market its value to the community.
