            1) What is the purpose of Brain-Score?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            The Brain-Score platform aims to yield strong computational models of the brain and mind. We enable researchers to quickly get a sense of the alignment of their model(s) to currently dozens of neural and behavioral measurements, and provide these models to experimentalists to prototype new experiments and make sense of biological data.

        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile question_text has-text-weight-bold no_top_header">
            2) What is a benchmark?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            A benchmark is composed of primate neural and/or behavioral data and metric. When a model is run on a benchmark, the metric outputs a score of how well the data matches the model.

        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile question_text has-text-weight-bold no_top_header">
            3) What is a metric?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            A metric scores how similar two sets of data are. Typically these two sets are model and primate measurements, but metrics are agnostic of the data source and can also be used to compare two primate measurements (e.g. for ceiling estimates).
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile question_text has-text-weight-bold no_top_header">
            4) What is a model?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            Specifically, "model" here refers to any computational model that implements the BrainModel (for Brain-Score Vision) or ArtificialSubject (for Brain-Score Language) API, which defines the interface that allows a conformant model to run on Brain-Score benchmarks. 
        </p>
         <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile question_text has-text-weight-bold no_top_header">
            5) What is a Brain-Score?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            A Brain-Score is a normalized scoring from 0.0 to 1.0 based on how closely model neural activations and/or behavior aligns with primate data as evaluated by each benchmark's metric. The result of running a model on a benchmark is a normalized score between 0 and 1 where 0 means the model does not match the measurements at all and 1 means the model matches the measurements at ceiling level (e.g. if the model obtains a score of 0.8 and the data ceiling is also 0.8, the score output by this method should be 1).

            6) What am I able to submit?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            You are able to submit a compressed directory containing an __init__.py, a setup.py file, a model file, and a test.py file. The __init__.py file adds your model to the Brain-Score registry. The tests.py file can remain blank for submission. The other two files are optional, but the setup.py file outlines the requirements that your model has. The model.py file defines the model itself.

        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile question_text has-text-weight-bold no_top_header">
            7) Am I able to keep my submissions private?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            While we do not currently support private code submissions -- at the moment, all submitted code is merged into our public GitHub repository -- this functionality is under development and anticipated to be available soon. An automated option for including private files with your submission is also planned; in the interim, please contact us with any files that need to remain private and we will upload them directly to our AWS S3.
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile question_text has-text-weight-bold no_top_header">
            8) I submitted a model but don't see it in my profile. Why not?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            There are a variety of reasons that your model may not be showing up in your profile. The submission and scoring process can vary depending on server availability, so if you haven't received an email indicating an error, it's possible that tests or scoring are still running. As every successful submission should result in a pull request in the relevant GitHub repository (<a href="https://github.com/brain-score/vision">vision</a> or <a href="https://github.com/brain-score/language">language</a>), you can check to see if there is either an open or closed PR with your model name in the title, which can provide further information about the status of your submission. If you need assistance, you can either create a GitHub issue or reach out via Slack explaining your problem and someone in our developer community will assist you.

        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile question_text has-text-weight-bold no_top_header">
            9) My submission passed. What now?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            Once the accepted submission has been processed, you should be seeing a Brain-Score of your model on the leaderboard now! If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to our developer community in Slack.
