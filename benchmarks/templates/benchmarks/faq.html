            1) What is the purpose of Brain-Score?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            The Brain-Score platform aims to yield strong computational models of the brain and mind. We enable researchers to quickly get a sense of the alignment of their model(s) to currently dozens of neural and behavioral measurements, and provide these models to experimentalists to prototype new experiments and make sense of biological data.

            2) What is a benchmark?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            A Benchmark is a set of packaged metrics and data that is used to reproduce an experiment that models can run on. These models use those metrics to generate a

            3) What is a metric?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            A metric is a set of neural and behavioral measurements for a given task. This is why it is so important to have it in a Benchmark- we need to know a model performs on a given experiment against biological subjects.

            4) What is a model?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            Specifically, "model" here refers to the BrainModel API, which defines the data structure that all submitted models need to follow. The Benchmarks all adhere to this API and will therefore only be run on models conforming to it.

         <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile question_text has-text-weight-bold no_top_header">
            5) What is a Brain-Score?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            A Brain-Score is a normalized neural-behavioral scoring from 0.0 to 1.0 based on how closely model performance aligns with the metrics at each benchmark. I.e. the output of a benchmark is a normalized score between 0 and 1 where 0 means the model does not match the measurements at all and 1 means the model matches the measurements at ceiling level (e.g. if the model obtains a score of 0.8 and the data ceiling is also 0.8, the score output by this method should be 1).

            6) What am I able to submit?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            You are able to submit a compressed directory containing an __init__.py, a setup.py file, a model file, and a test.py file. The __init__.py file adds your model to the Brain-Score registry. The tests.py file can remain blank for submission. The other two files are optional, but the setup.py file outlines the requirements that your model has. The model.py file defines the model itself.

            7) Am I able to keep my submissions private?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            With the Brain-Score 2.0 release, we do now support private submissions!

            8) I submitted a model but don't see it in my profile. Why not?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            There are a variety of reasons that your model may not be showing up in your profile. The submission and scoring process can vary depending on server availability, so if you haven't received an email indicating an error, it's possible that tests or scoring are still running. As every successful submission should result in a pull request in the relevant GitHub repository (<a href="https://github.com/brain-score/vision">vision</a> or <a href="https://github.com/brain-score/language">language</a>), you can check to see if there is either an open or closed PR with your model name in the title, which can provide further information about the status of your submission. If you need assistance, you can either create a GitHub issue or reach out via Slack explaining your problem and someone in our developer community will assist you.

            9) My submission passed. What now?
        </p>
        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter no_top">
            Once the accepted submission has been processed, you should be seeing a Brain-Score of your model on the leaderboard now! If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to our developer community in Slack.
