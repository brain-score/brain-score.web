            The process is very similar for scoring a language model. First, install the needed packages in Step 1 above,
            but just change all occurrences of vision to language, i.e:
            <span class="special_format"> brainscore_vision</span> becomes <span class="special_format">brainscore_language</span>.
            Next, simply call the language equivalent to the above vision command, which would be:
