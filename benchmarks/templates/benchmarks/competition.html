       <h2>FAQ</h2>
       <ol>
           <li>
               <h5>How do I submit a model?</h5>
               <p> We have a full length <a href="https://brain-score.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/model_tutorial.html">
                    tutorial</a> that walks users through the submission process- feel free to
                    take a look, as it covers model submission, scoring, and results.
               </p>
           </li>
           <li>
               <h5>Why did you choose these benchmarks to score models against?</h5>
               <p>
                   We currently use the PLS25 neural predictivity metric to rank models; this is an established metric,
                   but since it’s most likely far from perfect, we will iterate on this going forward.
                   We are also including novel, unpublished, recordings (Sanghavi2020, SanghaviJozwik2020, SanghaviMurty2020)-
                   these data are from a single monkey, and while we verified data quality and signal reliability,
                   the benchmarks are not vetted as strongly as the other datasets. We will discuss implications
                   and empirical results of these benchmarks at the Cosyne workshop.
                   Based on this year’s results, we will also discuss if we should only include benchmarks from
                   recordings with n>=2 monkeys. Please join the workshop and join the slack
                   channel if you have input on these questions!
               </p>
           </li>
           <li>
               <h4>I have data that could be useful -- can I submit a benchmark?</h4>
               <p>
                    We also have a tutorial for those who wish to submit benchmarks, found
                    <a href="https://brain-score.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/benchmark_tutorial.html">
                    here</a>. We strongly encourage those with useful data to submit a poster at the
                    <a href="https://www.cosyne.org/">COSYNE 2022</a> workshop as well.
               </p>

               <h4>Does my model have to beat the current most brain-like model on brain-score.org?</h4>
               <p>
                    Nope! You only have to be the best out of all the competition submissions.
