            Our ability to recognize objects in the world relies on visual processing along the ventral visual stream, a
            set of hierarchically-organized cortical areas. Recently, neuroscientists and machine-learning researchers
            have produced computational models that have achieved moderate success at explaining primate object
            recognition behavior and the neural representations that support it.
            <span class="has-text-weight-bold">
                The first edition of the Brain-Score Competition proposes to evaluate how well these models can predict
                primate object recognition in 27 neuronal and behavioral benchmarks.

            The Brain-Score Competition 2022 will be open to the scientific community and aims to accelerate the
            development of better models of primate vision. It will do so by providing an infrastructure to evaluate
            candidate models in a standardised and unified manner along a multitude of neuronal and behavioral
            benchmarks. In addition, it will incentivize model submissions by providing visibility to participants - via
            participation in a <a href="#workshop">Cosyne workshop</a> - and <a href="#tracks">monetary prizes</a>
            (total pool of <span id="prize-pool">$6,000</span>) to the best performing models.

            Participants should submit their models through the
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brain-score.org/profile/">Brain-Score platform</a>.
            Brain-Score currently accepts any image-computable model that can predict neural responses in ventral
            visual stream areas and/or object recognition behavior. While the overarching goal of the competition is to
            evaluate models that engage with the whole ventral visual stream, we also accept models that only attempt
            to model some of its components (see <a href="#tracks">Competition Tracks</a> below). Submitted models can
            be standard artificial neural networks (ANNs) for computer vision, which we call base models, or actual
            brain models with their internal components committed to specific visual areas, and their field-of-view
            mapped to a spatial visual extent (in visual degrees). To facilitate model submission, we provide helper
            wrappers for neural networks implemented in Pytorch, Tensorflow or Keras. For more information about model
            details, please check our
            <a target="_blank" href="https://brain-score.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/model_tutorial.html">
                tutorial</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Submitted models will be evaluated in a total of 27 neuronal and behavioral benchmarks related to activity
            in macaque visual cortical areas V1, V2, V4, and IT, and human psychophysical performance in a set of object
            classification tasks. Each benchmark contains a set of measurements as well as a comparative metric that
            evaluates how well the model can explain the experimental data. In the first edition of the Brain-Score
            Competition, the metrics will consist of a standard neural predictivity metric using PLS regression, the
            similarity of single-neuron response property distributions, and the alignment of object classification
            performance at the level of individual images (see <a href="#benchmarks">Benchmarks</a> below).

                                models of the primate ventral visual stream and object recognition behavior. We believe
                                that modelling this system as a whole, holds better promise for success than efforts
                                focused solely on modelling specific components. Thus, the main competition track will
                                simultaneously evaluate models in all the neuronal benchmarks for all the ventral stream
                                areas as well as in a behavioral benchmark. We will award the three models with the
                                highest overall scores, which consists of the average of five components: V1, V2, V4,
                                IT, and behavior.

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>How do I submit a model?</h4>
                <p> We have a full length
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://brain-score.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/model_tutorial.html">
                        tutorial</a> that walks users through the submission process- feel free to
                    take a look, as it covers model submission, scoring, and results.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Why did you choose these benchmarks to score models against?</h4>
                <p>
                    We currently use the PLS25 neural predictivity metric to rank models; this is an established
                    metric,
                    but since it’s most likely far from perfect, we will iterate on this going forward.
                    We are also including novel, unpublished, recordings (Sanghavi2020, SanghaviJozwik2020,
                    SanghaviMurty2020)-
                    these data are from a single monkey, and while we verified data quality and signal reliability,
                    the benchmarks are not vetted as strongly as the other datasets. We will discuss implications
                    and empirical results of these benchmarks at the Cosyne workshop.
                    Based on this year’s results, we will also discuss if we should only include benchmarks from
                    recordings with n>=2 monkeys. Please join the workshop and join the slack
                    channel if you have input on these questions!

                <h4>I have data that could be useful -- can I submit a benchmark?</h4>
                <p>
                    We also have a tutorial for those who wish to submit benchmarks, found
                    <a href="https://brain-score.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/benchmark_tutorial.html">
                        here</a>. We strongly encourage those with useful data to submit a poster at the
                    <a href="https://www.cosyne.org/">COSYNE 2022</a> workshop as well.

                <h4>Does my model have to beat the current most brain-like model on brain-score.org?</h4>
                <p>
                    Nope! You only have to be the best out of all the competition submissions.

                <h4>Is public data available?</h4>
                <p>
                    Yes. Public data splits of many of the benchmarks can be found
                    <a href="https://github.com/brain-score/brain-score/blob/master/brainscore/benchmarks/public_benchmarks.py#L87">here</a>.
                    Use the list_public_assemblies function
                    <a href="https://github.com/brain-score/brain-score/blob/master/brainscore/benchmarks/public_benchmarks.py#L87">
                        here</a> as well to view all available public data.
