        <p>
            Brain-Score is hosting a competition for the most brain-like ventral stream model,
            with a prize pool of <span id="prize-pool">$6,000</span>.
            Model submissions will automatically be tested on benchmarks ranging from V1 to IT to behavior,
            and <a href="#prizes">prizes will be awarded in three categories</a>.
        <p>

        <p>
            Submissions are open now until February 15, 2022.
            Check out the flyer below for more information.
            If you have any questions, please consult the FAQ section
            and feel free to reach out to the Brain-Score team.
            Good luck!

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h5>How do I submit a model?</h5>
                    <p> We have a full length <a
                            href="https://brain-score.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/model_tutorial.html">
                        tutorial</a> that walks users through the submission process- feel free to
                        take a look, as it covers model submission, scoring, and results.
                    </p>

                <li>
                    <h5>Why did you choose these benchmarks to score models against?</h5>
                    <p>
                        We currently use the PLS25 neural predictivity metric to rank models; this is an established
                        metric,
                        but since it’s most likely far from perfect, we will iterate on this going forward.
                        We are also including novel, unpublished, recordings (Sanghavi2020, SanghaviJozwik2020,
                        SanghaviMurty2020)-
                        these data are from a single monkey, and while we verified data quality and signal reliability,
                        the benchmarks are not vetted as strongly as the other datasets. We will discuss implications
                        and empirical results of these benchmarks at the Cosyne workshop.
                        Based on this year’s results, we will also discuss if we should only include benchmarks from
                        recordings with n>=2 monkeys. Please join the workshop and join the slack
                        channel if you have input on these questions!

                    <h4>I have data that could be useful -- can I submit a benchmark?</h4>
                    <p>
                        We also have a tutorial for those who wish to submit benchmarks, found
                        <a href="https://brain-score.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/benchmark_tutorial.html">
                            here</a>. We strongly encourage those with useful data to submit a poster at the
                        <a href="https://www.cosyne.org/">COSYNE 2022</a> workshop as well.

                    <p>
                        Nope! You only have to be the best out of all the competition submissions.
