                        split into two sections: model submission and benchmark submission. For models, this includes
                        how to submit a Resnet-50 model to the website, how to score and upload a custom model, and
                        how to submit a model via Github Pull Request. For benchmarks, we cover how to submit a new
                        data with an existing metric, as well as how to submit a new metric with existing data.
