                    <p>In this guide, learn how to install Brain-Score on your machine and how to score an existing
                        model on an existing benchmark. This will help familiarize you with the scoring system,
                        what these scores mean, and how to run any model on any of our publicly available
                        data benchmarks.</p>

                    <p>In these guides, we will cover more advanced topics and use cases of the platform. This is mainly
                        split into two sections: model submission and benchmark submission. For models, this includes
                        how to submit a Resnet-50 model to the website, how to score and upload a custom model, and
                        how to submit a model via Github Pull Request. For benchmarks, we cover how to submit a new
                        data with an existing metric, as well as how to submit a new metric with existing data.
