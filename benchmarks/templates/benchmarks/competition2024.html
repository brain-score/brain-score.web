            Our ability to recognize objects in the world relies on visual processing along the ventral visual stream, a
            set of hierarchically-organized cortical areas. Recently, machine-learning researchers and neuroscientists
            have produced computational models that have achieved moderate success at explaining primate object
            recognition behavior and the neural representations that support it.
            <span class="has-text-weight-bold">
                This second edition of the Brain-Score Competition aims to find benchmarks
                on which the predictions of our current top models break down.

        <br/>
        <p>
            In 2022, the first Brain-Score Competition lead to new and improved models of primate vision that predicted
            existing benchmarks reasonably well.
            In this year's Brain-Score Competition 2024, we will close the loop on testing model predictions
            by rewarding those <span class="has-text-weight-bold">benchmarks</span>
            that show where models are the least aligned to the primate visual ventral stream.
            The Competition is open to the scientific community and we provide an infrastructure to evaluate
            a variety of models on new behavioral and neural benchmarks in a standardised and unified manner.
            In addition, we will incentivize benchmark submissions by providing visibility to participants
            and <a href="#tracks">monetary prizes</a> (details TBA) to the winning benchmarks.

            Participants should submit their benchmarks through the
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brain-score.org/profile/">Brain-Score platform</a>.
            Brain-Score currently accepts any benchmark engaging on testing model predictions of
            core object recognition behavior and neural responses (spike rates) along the ventral visual stream areas.
            We encourage all submissions of behavioral and neural benchmarks.
            To facilitate benchmark submission, we provide
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/brain-score/vision">helper code</a>
            and
            <a target="_blank" href="https://brain-score.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/benchmark_tutorial.html">
                tutorials</a>.
            You can also use existing datasets or metrics and re-combine them in novel ways.
            Note that by using the Brain-Score platform, no model knowledge is required --
            you can treat them like another primate subject.
        </p>
        <p>
            Benchmarks have to use models in their current "operating regime".
            This means that there are three behavioral tasks (imagenet-labeling, probabilities, odd-one-out),
            and four brain regions to record from (V1, V2, V4, IT).
            Until April, we will accept suggestions of other behavioral tasks provided you work with us
            to make sure the models can engage on them.
            The stimuli should be static images (e.g. no videos this round).
            In this round, benchmarks should not test temporal dynamics
            (but you can still specify a single "time_bin" from the models to record from.)
