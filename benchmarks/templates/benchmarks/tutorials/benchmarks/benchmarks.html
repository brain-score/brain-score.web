                In a nutshell, if you want to add your experimental results into Brain-Score as a benchmark, the process
                involves two main steps: first, you need to add your experimental stimuli as well as subject data. This
                is covered in the first section of this tutorial, "Package Data".
            </p>
            <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile">
                The second half involves creating and defining the benchmark file itself:
                This is how and where you choose benchmark hyperparameters, such as visual degrees, a metric, and
                a ceiling. This is covered in the section "Create a Benchmark" of this tutorial.

                 Note: Brain-Score supports three types of benchmarks, differentiated by the type of experimental data
                 that was gathered: neural (fMRI, PSTH, EEG, etc), behavioral, and engineering. In this
                 benchmark tutorial series, we will explore a sample behavioral benchmark,
