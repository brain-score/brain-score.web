            <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile">
                In this guide, we will explore a sample behavioral benchmark, <span class="special_format">Ferguson2024</span>.
                This should serve as a baseline for those interested in packaging their own data, in preparation to turn it into a Brain-Score
                benchmark.
            </p>
            <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile">
                This section is divided into three parts:
                First, we are going to explore the <span class="special_format">data_packaging.py</span> file. This file
                consists of how we upload and package both your stimuli (via a <span class="special_format">stimulus_set</span>),
                and your data (via an <span class="special_format">assembly</span>).

                Next, we will explore the <span class="special_format">__init__.py</span> file, which adds the data plugin
                to the data registry (i.e., it tells Brain-Score that your data exists in our system).

                Finally, we will explore a sample <span class="special_format">test.py</span> file, in which we ensure
                your benchmark is structured as you expect it.

            <h3 class="benefits_heading is-size-3-mobile">Part 1: Install Necessary Packages</h3>
            <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile">
                The first thing you are going to want to do is clone the Brain-Score repository, in order to access it.
                You can do this with commands found on the model quickstart <a href="https://www.brain-score.org/tutorials/models/quickstart">here</a>,
                in Part 1.
            </p>
            <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile">
                If you have already done the Quickstart, or installed Brain-Score, skip to Part 2 to the right.

            <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile">
                Brain-Score allows users to submit plugins in two ways: directly to the site, via a Zip file
                upload, or through a Github PR. In this first packaging tutorial, you will explore a sample data plugin
                in order to become familiar with it's structure. You can download the sample zip file <a href="{% static "/benchmarks/packaging_tutorial.zip" %}" download="packaging_tutorial.zip">here</a>.
                The sample Zip file contains a properly formatted, stock version of ResNet-50 pretrained on ImageNet.
            </p>
             <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile">
                In Deep Dives 2 and 3, we will look at a custom model submission, as well as prepare to submit a
                 model via Github Pull Request respectively.

    <h3 class="benefits_heading is-size-3-mobile">Part 3: Exploring the Starter Submission File</h3>
    <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
        After unzipping the <span class="special_format">packaging_submission.zip</span> file, you will see that the root folder is
        called <span class="special_format">packaging_tutorial</span>. This in turns contains another folder for the plugin itself, in
        this case <span class="special_format">/models</span>. This <span class="special_format">/models</span> folder then
        contains a folder called <span class="special_format"> /resnet50_tutorial</span>.
        This final also contains 4 other Python files. The overall structure of the submission
        package is shown below:
    </p>
    <img class="submission example" width="500" height="auto" src="{% static "/benchmarks/img/submission_structure.png" %}" />
    <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
        Just like the sample submission, each submission that you submit must contain at least the 2 required
        Python files: <span class="special_format">__init__.py</span> and <span class="special_format">test.py</span>.
        The other two files, <span class="special_format">setup.py</span> and <span class="special_format">model.py</span>,
        are optional, but will be explored below along with the two required files. Let's explore further with the first required file,
        <span class="special_format">__init__.py</span> file.
    </p>
    <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter is-italic">
        Note: this would also be the same overall structure as your submission
        package, or if you are submitting any other plugins (benchmarks, metrics, or data). Feel free
        to base your future submissions off of this package, just please do not submit the
    <span class="special_format">resnet50_tutorial</span> model.

    <h3 class="benefits_heading is-size-3-mobile">Part 4: Exploring the  __init__.py  file</h3>
    <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
        This file adds your plugin to the Brain-Score plugin registry and to the Brain-Score
        ecosystem at large. You are registering your model to a unique global identifier. You can
        see that this file is fairly straightforward. Lines 1-3 are standard imports, and line 5
        adds the plugin to the registry. In the future, when you submit models (or other plugins),
        you will add the plugin to our ecosystem via line 5.

    </code></pre>
    <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
        Please note: Brain-Score does not allow duplicate plugin
        names, so if you submit another version of the same model, make sure to make the identifier unique!
    </p>
    <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
        Also note: It would be prohibitively time- and resource-consuming to actually load every plugin
        in a registry before they are needed, so the plugin discovery process relies on string parsing.
        This unfortunately means that it’s not possible to programmatically add plugin identifiers to
        the registry; each registration needs to be written explicitly in the form of
        <span class="special_format">plugin_registry['my_plugin_identifier']</span>
        Next, let’s check out the second required file, <span class="special_format">test.py</span> file.

<div class="box leaderboard-table-component">
    <h3 class="benefits_heading is-size-3-mobile">Part 5: Exploring the test.py File</h3>
    <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
        You will notice that the submission's <span class="special_format">test.py</span> file is blank. This is a
        temporary status, as the Brain-Score Team is currently writing a suite of tests that can be incorporated into
        this file, that every model will run.
    </p>
    <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
        For now, if you are submitting a model yourself, you can just leave this file blank, but still make sure
        to include it in your submission package.

    <h3 class="benefits_heading is-size-3-mobile">Part 6: Exploring an (optional) setup.py  File</h3>
    <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
        This file is where you can add any requirements that your model needs. You can do this by simply
        adding the packages to the in the requirements dictionary on lines 6-8. If your model
        had any extra requirements, such as a specific version of a package or an external git
        repository, you would add it to the list defined on line 6. Lines 10 - 25 are just
        administrative definitions, and can be left untouched.

        Note: The reason why <span class="special_format">setup.py</span> is optional is that you can also use a
        <span class="special_format">requirements.txt</span> or <span class="special_format">pyproject</span> file to
        add any other requirements that you might need. If your model needs no extra packages, you can exclude this from

    <h3 class="benefits_heading is-size-3-mobile">Part 7: Exploring an (optional) model.py  File</h3>
    <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
        This file is usually where the model itself is defined. The reason why this is optional is that using
        <span class="special_format">model.py</span> is a convention we use to
        separate code, but that is not needed. It is also plugin-specific. We think it is good practice,
        however, to use a separate <span class="special_format">model.py</span> for models, to keep things neat.
    </p>
    <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
        Let’s explore this file in more detail: Lines 1 - 9 are standard imports. Lines
        20-21 define the <span class="special_format">get_model_list()</span> function that simply returns the model identifier.
        Next, lines 24-30 define the <span class="special_format">get_model()</span> function that gets the model itself.
        You can see on line 26 the model itself is being loaded from <span class="special_format">pytorch</span>. If you have a custom
        model that you have created yourself, check out our Custom Model Submission Guide here in
        Deep Dive 2. Lines 33 - 35 contain the <span class="special_format">get_layers()</span> function, which returns the layers you
        are interested in scoring.

        You are almost done! If you were actually submitting a model, the final step would be to run your model locally,

        M1 Max MacBook Pro, so your run times may vary.
