                The Brain-Score platform allows users to score models on public data via the command line
                on your machine, once installed. It also allows scoring models on all data
                (public and private) via the website. In the section we will cover how to use the CLI to
                score a model on public data.
            </p>
            <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile">
                We highly recommend you complete this quickstart before trying to submit a model to the site. Not only will
                the quickstart show you what to expect from a score, but it will better prepare you to submit a plugin
                and get a score on all benchmarks!

            <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile">
                In order to use Brain-Score on your machine, you need to install it. Luckily, we have tried
                to drastically simplify this process (we strongly recommend setting up a Virtual Environment
                for all your Brain-Score projects, but this is not required)
                Run the three commands to the left in the command line of your choosing (example is for Unix-based machines):
            </p>
            <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile">
                This will pull the most recent copy of Brain-Score into your local machine and install
                all the necessary packages.

    <h3 class="benefits_heading is-size-3-mobile">Step 2: Run a model on a benchmark (via CLI)</h3>
    <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
        Next, make sure your working directory is <span class="special_format">/brain-score</span> (you can confirm
        this is the case with a <span class="special_format">pwd</span> call), and run the three commands below to score the model
        <span class="special_format">pixels</span> on a sample benchmark’s publicly available data
        <span class="special_format">MajajHong2015public.IT-pls</span>:
    </p>
    <pre class="modified_1"><code >
python brainscore_vision score --model_identifier='pixels' --benchmark_identifier='MajajHong2015public.IT-pls'
    </code></pre>

    <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
        Upon scoring completion, you should get a message like below, indicating what the score is.
    </p>
    <pre class="modified_1"><code >


         * update with new format *
xarray.Score (aggregation: 2)

    </code></pre>
    <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
                Let’s break down what these numbers mean. First off, your score is <span class="special_format">0.0153</span>, the first number
                in the first xarray listed, along with the error, which is <span class="special_format">0.00571</span>. Next, you can see two
                other attributes: <span class="special_format">raw</span>, which represents the unceiled score
                <span class="special_format">0.1019</span> of your model, and the
                ceiling <span class="special_format">8.28*10-2</span>, which is the highest score a perfect model is expected to get. Your final score above thus
                is a simple calculation of <span class="special_format">raw/ceiling</span>.

        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
            The process is very similar for scoring a language model. First, install the needed packages in Step 1 above,
            but just change all occurrences of vision to language, i.e:
            <span class="special_format"> brainscore_vision</span> becomes <span class="special_format">brainscore_language</span>.
            Next, simply call the language equivalent to the above vision command, which would be:

python brainscore_language score --model_identifier='distilgpt2' --benchmark_identifier='Futrell2018-pearsonr'

    <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
        Where, in this case, we are calling the <span class="special_format">brainscore-language</span> library to score the
        language model <span class="special_format">distilgpt2</span>
        on the language benchmark <span class="special_format">Futrell2018-pearsonr</span>.
