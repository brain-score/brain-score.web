                        In this first Deep Dive, we provide resources intended to help new users come up to speed
                        on the theory and background of Brain-Score.  In particular, we provide links to publications and
                        presentations, as well as other documentation and code.
                    </p>
                    <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile">
                        Even a brand-new user with no prior Brain-Score experience that goes through these recommended sources
                        will come away with an understanding of what and why Brain-Score is what it is.  The following Deep Dives
                        will then fill in the gaps on how to use it.

    <h3 class="benefits_heading is-size-3-mobile">Part 1: The Philosophy of BrainScore</h3>
    <div class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile">
        A potentially organizing goal of the brain and cognitive sciences is to accurately explain domains of human
        intelligence as executable, neurally mechanistic models. Years of research have led to models that capture
        experimental results in individual behavioral tasks and individual brain regions. We here advocate for taking
        the next step: integrating experimental results from many laboratories into suites of benchmarks that, when
        considered together, push mechanistic models toward explaining entire domains of intelligence, such as vision,
        language, and motor control. Given recent successes of neurally mechanistic models and the surging availability
        of neural, anatomical, and behavioral data, we believe that now is the time to create integrative benchmarking
        platforms (such as BrainScore) that incentivize ambitious, unified models.
