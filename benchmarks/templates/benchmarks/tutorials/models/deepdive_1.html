                One of the biggest benefits of Brain-Score is its integrative benchmarking, which allows users to submit
                a model and evaluate its performance across multiple benchmarks. This often leads to new insights and
                interesting findings.
            </p>
            <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile">
                In this first Deep Dive, we'll examine a sample Brain-Score submission package containing the model ResNet-50.
                You can then base your own unique submission packages on this sample.  In Deep Dives 2 and 3, we'll
                explore custom model submissions and how to submit models via GitHub Pull Requests.

            <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile">
                We highly recommend completing the <a href="https://www.brain-score.org/tutorials/models/quickstart">Quickstart Tutorial</a> before
                starting this Deep Dive. The Quickstart explains how to install the necessary packages for Brain-Score
                and also gives insight into what model scores mean, and how to score a model
                locally on a single, publicly available benchmark.

            <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile">
                Brain-Score allows users to submit packages in two ways: directly to the site, via a Zip file
                upload, or through a Github PR. In this Deep Dive, you will explore a sample model submission
                in order to become familiar with the submission package structure. You can view the sample submission folder (resnet50_tutorial)
                <a href="https://github.com/brain-score/vision/tree/master/brainscore_vision/models/resnet50_tutorial">here</a>.
                This sample submission folder contains a properly formatted, stock version of ResNet-50 pretrained on ImageNet.

    <h3 class="benefits_heading is-size-3-mobile">Part 3: Exploring the Starter Submission Folder</h3>
    <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
        The correct overall structure for a model submission package is shown in the code inset below.  The root folder
        can be named anything (in this case it's called "packaging_tutorial").  The root folder contains another folder
        for the plugin itself, in this case <span class="special_format">/models</span>.
        This <span class="special_format">/models</span> folder then contains a folder called
        <span class="special_format"> /resnet50_tutorial</span>.
    </p>
        The <a href="https://github.com/brain-score/vision/tree/master/brainscore_vision/models/resnet50_tutorial">resnet50_tutorial folder</a> in the repo
        is an example of a properly formatted submission folder; it contains 3 Python files and a single .txt file.
        Just like this example, all submissions must contain at least three Python files:
        <span class="special_format">__init__.py</span>, <span class="special_format">test.py</span>,
        and <span class="special_format">model.py</span> (these are required).
        The other file: <span class="special_format">requirements.txt</span>, is optional but will be examined below
        along with the required files. Let's explore further with the first required file,
        <span class="special_format">__init__.py</span> file.

    <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
        The example <a href="https://github.com/brain-score/vision/blob/master/brainscore_vision/models/resnet50_tutorial/__init__.py">__init__.py file</a> adds your plugin to the Brain-Score plugin registry and to the Brain-Score
        ecosystem at large. You are registering your model to a unique global identifier. You can
        see that this file is fairly straightforward. Lines 1-3 are standard imports, and line 5
        adds the plugin to the registry. Please note: Brain-Score does not allow duplicate plugin
        names, so if you submit another version of the same model, make sure to make the identifier unique!
    </p>

    <pre class="modified_1"><code>
1       from brainscore_vision import model_registry
2       from brainscore_vision.model_helpers.brain_transformation import ModelCommitment
3       from .model import get_model, get_layers

5       model_registry['resnet50_tutorial'] = lambda: ModelCommitment(identifier='resnet50_tutorial', activations_model=get_model('resnet50_tutorial'), layers=get_layers('resnet50_tutorial'))
    </code></pre>
    <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
        Also note: It would be prohibitively time- and resource-consuming to actually load every plugin
        in a registry before they are needed, so the plugin discovery process relies on string parsing.
        Thus, it’s not possible to programmatically add plugin identifiers to
        the registry; each registration needs to be written explicitly in the form of
        <span class="special_format">plugin_registry['my_plugin_identifier']</span>
        Next, let’s check out the second required file, <span class="special_format">test.py</span> file.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="box leaderboard-table-component">
    <h3 class="benefits_heading is-size-3-mobile">Part 5: Exploring the test.py File</h3>
    <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
        The example <a href="https://github.com/brain-score/vision/blob/master/brainscore_vision/models/resnet50_tutorial/test.py">test.py file</a> included in the resnet50_tutorial package contains
        a Python test function designed to test if a model loaded with the <span class="special_format">brainscore_vision.load_model</span>
        function has the correct identifier. The test function, <span class="special_format">test_has_identifier()</span>,
        loads a model named <span class="special_format">'resnet50_tutorial'</span> and asserts that the identifier
        attribute of the loaded model matches the expected string <span class="special_format">'resnet50_tutorial'</span>.
        This example test.py is only a temporary placeholder, as the Brain-Score Team is currently writing a suite of
        tests that can be incorporated into this file, that every model will run.  When submitting a model, a test.py
        file must be included in the submission package (though it can be left blank).

    <h3 class="benefits_heading is-size-3-mobile">Part 6: Exploring the model.py File</h3>
    <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
        Here is an example <a href="https://github.com/brain-score/vision/blob/master/brainscore_vision/models/resnet50_tutorial/model.py">model.py file</a>.
        This is where a user would actually define the model, load
        weights, and wrap it into a Brain-Score model. Let’s explore this file in more detail: Lines 1 - 5 are standard imports.
        Lines 15-21 define the <span class="special_format">get_model()</span> function that loads the model.
        You can see on line 17 the model itself is being loaded from <span class="special_format">pytorch</span>.  Line 20 is used to define the
        input size for the network being passed in.  Lines 24 - 26 contain the <span class="special_format">get_layers()</span> function, which returns the layers you
        are interested in scoring.  Layer names will typically follow pytorch conventions.  Lines 29 and 30 define the Bibtex for the model. You can leave this blank when submitting,
        but we highly recommend you add a reference. Finally, lines 33 - 34 call the model on what's called
        a MockBenchmark which uses artificially generated data sufficient to check the model's integrity, but
        meaningless as a benchmark.

        You are almost done! If you were actually submitting a model, the final step prior to submission would be to run
        your model locally to ensure that everything is in working order. You can do this by first following the
        <a href="https://www.brain-score.org/tutorials/models/quickstart">Quickstart Tutorial</a> to install the
        necessary packages for Brain-Score. Then, (as explained in the Quickstart) make sure your working directory is
        <span class="special_format">/vision</span>, and run the command below to score the model
        <span class="special_format">YOUR_MODEL_IDENTIFIER</span> on the publicly available data of a benchmark
        called <span class="special_format">MajajHong2015public.IT-pls</span>.  (NOTE: Make sure to replace YOUR_MODEL_IDENTIFIER
        with the actual model identifier you used to add your mode to the Brain-Score model registry in __init__.py.)
