                Brain-Score also supports the submission of plugins via a Github Pull Request (PR).
                For a complete description of what the required files are, as well as what to include in
                each, please refer to <a href="http{% if request.is_secure %}s{% endif %}://{{ request.get_host }}/tutorial/models/deepdive_1">Deep Dive 1</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile">
                To submit via PR, simply open a Pull Request with your submission on the appropriate domain's Github
                repository. If you submit via PR, one of the members of the Brain-Score team
                will review it and either merge it or suggest any needed fixes. Once this PR is merged,
                it will be scored, and you will get an email back with scores just like you would for a
                website submission.
