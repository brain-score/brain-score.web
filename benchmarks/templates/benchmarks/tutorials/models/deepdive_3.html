                Deep Dive 3 will go over how to create and submit your own custom model
                package. This Deep Dive assumes that you have completed both the <a href="https://www.brain-score.org/tutorials/models/quickstart">Quickstart Tutorial</a>,
                <a href="http{% if request.is_secure %}s{% endif %}://{{ request.get_host }}/tutorials/models/deepdive_1">Deep Dive #1</a>, and

            <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile">
                <strong>Part 1</strong> will discuss how the tutorial model package from <a href="http{% if request.is_secure %}s{% endif %}://{{ request.get_host }}/tutorials/models/deepdive_1">Deep Dive #1</a>
                can be modified to create your own custom model. In particular, we'll look at a single required change in the
                <span class="special_format">__init__.py</span> file, and more extensive changes required in the
                <span class="special_format">model.py</span> file. <strong>Part 2</strong> will cover some resources that
                might be beneficial in creating your own models, and finally, <strong>Part 3</strong> will provide directions on how to submit your model
                through the BrainScore website, as well as directly through the BrainScore GitHub repository.

    <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
        The submission package for a custom model is nearly identical to the <a href="https://github.com/brain-score/vision/tree/master/brainscore_vision/models/resnet50_tutorial">sample resnet50_tutorial submission folder</a> we examined in
        detail in <a href="http{% if request.is_secure %}s{% endif %}://{{ request.get_host }}/tutorials/models/deepdive_1">Deep Dive #1</a>. The only changes will be to the
        <span class="special_format">model.py</span> and the <span class="special_format">__init__.py</span> files as we need to first define our model and then add it to the
        Brain-Score ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
        First, regarding <span class="special_format">__init__.py</span> file; this file is discussed in detail in
        <a href="http{% if request.is_secure %}s{% endif %}://{{ request.get_host }}/tutorials/models/deepdive_1">Deep Dive #1</a>, and as stated there,
        it's important to ensure that the identifier you specify in for the model_registry is unique.
    </p>

        <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
        Next, let's look at the <span class="special_format">model.py</span> file.  The  <span class="special_format">model.py</span> file in the <a href="https://github.com/brain-score/vision/tree/master/brainscore_vision/models/resnet50_tutorial">sample resnet50_tutorial submission folder</a>
        that we looked at in <a href="http{% if request.is_secure %}s{% endif %}://{{ request.get_host }}/tutorials/models/deepdive_1">Deep Dive #1</a> was used to load a pre-trained model.  Instead of loading a pre-trained model,
        we show here how to use the <span class="special_format">model.py</span> file to define a completely new model.

        Lines 1-15 are the standard imports needed for the Brain-Score library. Next, lines 18-33 define the custom

        The <span class="special_format">init</span> function on lines 19-25 initializes the model by setting up its layers.
        More specifically, in line 21, a convolution layer is created which takes a stimuli with 3 channels (typically RGB),
        applies 2 filters, and uses a 3x3 kernel. Line 22 uses a ReLU activation function to introduce non-linearity after convolution.
        Line 23 calculates the input size for the fully connected layer based on the output of the convolution layer
        (assuming an input image size of 224x2). In line 24, a fully connected layer connects the flattened output of the
        convolution layer to a 1000-dimensional output. How the conv1 layer is producing a flattened output is described
        in Line 30 in the forward function using x.view(x.size(0)). Finally, in line 25, another ReLU activation function
        is used to transform the output of the fully connected layer.

            <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
             When creating a custom model, we recommend following the guidelines and processes for creating PyTorch models.
             An excellent tutorial can be found on the <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/introyt/modelsyt_tutorial.html">PyTorch model creation page</a>.
            </p>
             <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
             This page gives background on the types of model layers available (such as linear, convolutional, recurrent,
             or data manipulation layers) as well as different types of activation functions, and even some discussion of
             advanced architectures like transformers.
            </p>
            <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
             NOTE:  If you adhere to PyTorch's recommended procedures, your model should be compatible with BrainScore.
             However, please ensure that the outputs of any layers for which you want BrainScore to evaluate layer
             activations are formatted as tensors. It's important to note that while PyTorch models can be created
             such that layers output data in other formats, such as tuples or numpy arrays, BrainScore requires
             tensor-formatted layer outputs for proper evaluation.

            <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile">
                There are two ways to submit your completed model.  The first is through the <a href="https://www.brain-score.org/">BrainScore website</a>
                and the second is directly through the <a href="https://github.com/brain-score">BrainScore Github repository</a> for
                the appropriate domain (Vision or Language).  If you submit through the website, your submission package must be set up
                with the proper directory structure described in Part 3 of <a href="http{% if request.is_secure %}s{% endif %}://{{ request.get_host }}/tutorials/models/deepdive_1">Deep Dive #1</a>, and
                then compressed into a zip file.  If you submit through a Github PR, then you just need the model folder containing the four files
                (also) described in <a href="http{% if request.is_secure %}s{% endif %}://{{ request.get_host }}/tutorials/models/deepdive_1">Deep Dive #1</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile">
                To submit directly through Github, prepare your
                submission folder with the four files discussed in <a href="http{% if request.is_secure %}s{% endif %}://{{ request.get_host }}/tutorials/models/deepdive_1">Deep Dive #1</a>
                Then place this folder in <a href="https://github.com/brain-score/vision/tree/master/brainscore_vision/models">/models (for Vision)</a>
                or <a href="https://github.com/brain-score/language/tree/main/brainscore_language/models">/models (for Language)</a>.
                Then simply open a Pull Request and a member of the Brain-Score team
                will review it and either merge it or suggest changes. Once this PR is merged,
                it will be scored, and you will receive an email containing those scores.
                NOTE: If you are submitting a plugin without other changes and don't need a review,
                you can use the automerge tag with your PR and it will be merged automatically after merging tests.
            </p>
            <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile">
                The second way to submit is through the <a href="https://www.brain-score.org/">BrainScore website</a>.  Click on either Vision or Language,
                and then click on the "Submit" button on the right hand side of the page, and follow the instructions to submit.  NOTE:  You will have
                to first create a BrainScore account and be logged in to submit a custom model.
