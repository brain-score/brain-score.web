                In this second Deep Dive, we will explore a custom model submission package, available for download
                <a href="{% static "/benchmarks/custom_packaging_tutorial.zip" %}" download="custom_packaging_tutorial.zip">here</a>.
                However, in order to do this tutorial, we highly recommend you complete both
                the Quickstart and Deep Dive 1, as they will show you how to both score a model locally and
                structure your submission package for upload.
            </p>
            <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile">
                Luckily, the submission package for a custom model is nearly identical to our sample project Zip that
                we explored in Deep Dive 1. The only changes will be to the <span class="special_format">__init__.py</span>
                file <span class="special_format">model.py</span> files, as we need to define our model and add it into the
                Brain-Score ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile is-italic">
                Note: As with Deep Dive 1, please do not submit the model that you prepare in this tutorial. This guide

        Lines 1-15 are the standard imports needed for the Brain-Score library, as well as some comments regarding model
        GPU uses. Next, lines 18-33 define the model itself, via a class named <span class="special_format">MyCustomModel</span>.
        This is where you would add in your custom model, or you can simply import it if your model is complex/located in a different file.
    </p>
    <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
        Lines 36-37 tells Brain-Score which models to look at. You can add as many models as you would like, but just
        make sure to add their names here. As we only have one model, which we named <span class="special_format">my_custom_model</span>,
        this is the only model defined in the list on line 37.
    </p>
    <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
        Line 42 is a call to Brain-Score's built in vision model <span class="special_format">preprocessing</span>. This is standard, and you should not have
        to worry too much about this.  Next up are line 43 and 44, which allow us to actually get the activations model
        from our PyTorch Wrapper and to make the model into a Brain-Score <span class="special_format">ModelCommitment</span>, respectively. See the below
        section for why we need the ModelCommitment.

    <p class="benefits_info is-size-5-mobile shorter">
        Lastly,  lines 51-53 are where you tell Brain-Score which model layers to include, and lines 56-57 are where you
        would add in your model's <span class="special_format">Bibtex</span>.

                The last piece of the custom submission package we will explore is the <span class="special_format">__init__.py</span> file. This file is nearly identical
                to the <span class="special_format">__init__.py</span> file in the previous Deep Dive, the only difference is that we
                replaced the <span class="special_format">resnet-50</span> model with our custom model, named the
                <span class="special_format">my_custom_model</span>. If you were submitting a custom model, be sure to add it to the
                <span class="special_format">model_registry</span> list on line 5.

                It is at this point that, in keeping with the process outlined in Deep Dive 1,
                that you would run the <span class="special_format">model.py</span> file and look for the success message. After that, you could zip your package and
                submit it! Feel free to explore the last Deep Dive
