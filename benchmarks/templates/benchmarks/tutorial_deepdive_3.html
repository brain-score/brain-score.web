                    </h3>
                       <p>Brain-Score also supports the submission of plugins via a Github Pull Request (PR).
                           This is another simple way to allow your plugins to be scored or uploaded to the Brain-Score
                           ecosystem. If you are submitting a model, then all that is required to be in the PR are the
                           4 required files structured like so: <p/>
<br><pre>
<code class="language-python">
/models (root folder to zip/unzip)
    /resnet-50_deepdive-2 (your model folder)
        setup.py
        model.py
        test.py
         __init__.py
</code>
</pre><br>
                    <p>
                           For a complete description of what each of these files are, as well as what to include in
                           each, please refer to deep dive 1. To submit via PR, simply open a PR with your
                           files to the branch on Github. We hope to support automatic PR merging soon. However,
                           for the time being, if you submit via PR, one of the members of the Brain-Score team
                           will review it and either merge it or suggest any needed fixes. Once this PR is merged,
                           it will be scored, and you will get an email back with scores just like you would for a
                           website submission.
