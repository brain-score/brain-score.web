                       <p>This guide will show you how to submit a model that you created yourself.
                           In order to do this tutorial, you must complete Use Case 1, as it will show you how to
                           structure your submission package, upload it to Brain-Score, and receive a score.
                           The only difference that this module has over Use Case 1 is the model.py file itself will
                           contain additional things, most notably a custom model Class. It is recommended that you
                           complete the Quickstart, as it will show you how to install all packages for Brain-Score.
                           You can view those steps here. As in Use Case 1, we recommend downloading our sample Zip,
                           found here. Note that it follows the same structure as our Alexnet submission, with the 4
                           required files. Most of these files will only need minimal changes from our sample zip.

                    <h3 class="benefits_heading is-size-3-mobile">Step 1: Adding a Custom Model</h3>
                       <p> Let’s open up model.py in our sample project. It will currently not run, and that is okay
                           - we are going to add in what we need in order to get our custom models submitted.
                           First, let’s actually add in a model. Luckily we have a toy example ready to go, shown below:

                            # define your custom model here:
                            class MyModel(nn.Module):
                                def __init__(self):
                                    super(MyModel, self).__init__()
                                    self.conv1 = torch.nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=2, kernel_size=3)
                                    self.relu1 = torch.nn.ReLU()
                                    linear_input_size = np.power((224 - 3 + 2 * 0) / 1 + 1, 2) * 2
                                    self.linear = torch.nn.Linear(int(linear_input_size), 1000)
                                    self.relu2 = torch.nn.ReLU()  # can't get named ReLU output otherwise

                                def forward(self, x):
                                    x = self.conv1(x)
                                    x = self.relu1(x)
                                    x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
                                    x = self.linear(x)
                                    x = self.relu2(x)
                                    return x
                           Copy and paste this model into line 20 in your sample model.py file. Now we have a custom
                           model! Overall, and more generally, if you want to add in a custom model, simply add the
                           class of the model before the other methods in the models.py file.

                    <h3 class="benefits_heading is-size-3-mobile">Step 2: Hooking up our Custom Model to Brain-Score </h3>
                       <p>You can see on line 38 the call to Brain-Score’s preprocessing - this is standard, and you
                           shouldn’t have to worry about this. Next, on line 42, we are going to add in this line:
                           activations_model = PytorchWrapper(identifier='my-model', model=MyModel(), preprocessing=preprocessing)
                           This allows us to actually get the activations model from our PyTorch Wrapper. Next we
                           actually want to make the model into a Brain-Score ModelCommitment. You can do this by adding
                           at line 30 the following lines: model = ModelCommitment(identifier='my-model', activations_model=activations_model,
                        # specify layers to consider
                        layers=['conv1', 'relu1', 'relu2'])
                           That’s really it! The rest of the model.py file is the same as our Resnet50 Sample Submission
                           in Deep Dive 1, so be sure to reference that if you are lost. The submission process is also
                           the exact same as Deep Dive 1.
