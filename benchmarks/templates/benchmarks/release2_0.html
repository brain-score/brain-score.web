        <div class="content">
            We are thrilled to introduce Brain-Score 2.0, a major upgrade to the Brain-Score platform
            that empowers researchers, developers, and enthusiasts
            in the fields of neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence
            to directly compare computational models of the brain
            with human and non-human primate behavior and brain recordings.

        <h3 class="subtitle is-3">Here are the Brain-Score 2.0 features we are most excited about:</h3>

        <h4 class="subtitle is-4">Flexibility: new plugin system for easier contribution and collaboration</h4>
        <div class="content">
            Brain-Score 2.0 introduces a modular
            <a href="https://github.com/brain-score/vision/tree/master/brainscore_vision">plugin system</a>
            that makes it easy to develop, combine, and contribute data, metrics, benchmarks, and models.
            Researchers can now more easily submit their own components and stress-test leading models
            or submit their own state-of-the-art model.
        </div>

        <h4 class="subtitle is-4">Accessibility: enhanced website and documentation</h4>
        <div class="content">
            Brain-Score’s <a href="https://www.brain-score.org/">web presence</a> got a facelift.
            Our revamped website provides an improved user experience with more intuitive navigation,
            a simplified <a href="https://www.brain-score.org/vision/">leaderboard</a>, and detailed
            <a href="https://www.brain-score.org/tutorial/">tutorials</a>.
            We believe that making the platform easier to use is crucial for fostering collaboration and innovation.
        </div>

        <h4 class="subtitle is-4">Language: broadening to a new domain</h4>
        <div class="content">
            Brain-Score 2.0 introduces <a href="http://www.brain-score.org/language/">Brain-Score Language</a>,
            which extends the Brain-Score platform from modeling the visual ventral stream to the human language
            system.
            The addition of Brain-Score Language reflects our philosophy that
            the Brain-Score approach to model benchmarking is fundamentally domain agnostic,
            and represents a step toward a future multimodal Brain-Score.

    <section id="competition" class="section container center">
        <h3 class="subtitle is-3">Brain-Score benchmarking competition</h3>
        <div class="content">
            In 2022, we organized the first Brain-Score competition for model submissions which were tested
            on our existing benchmarks and led to new state-of-the-art models of the primate visual ventral stream.
            In 2024 — we have turned the table!

            This year, in the spirit of an adversarial collaboration — we invite experimentalists and the community at
            large
            to turn their legitimate concerns into concrete benchmarks that will challenge and
            hopefully expose the explanatory gaps between our current models of primate vision and the biological brain.

    <section id="future" class="section container center">
        <h3 class="subtitle is-3">And here’s what is currently in the works:</h3>

        <h4 class="subtitle is-4">Support for private code submissions</h4>
        <div class="content">
            While all submitted code is currently merged into our public GitHub repository,
            support for private submissions is under active development and we anticipate it to be available soon.
            Submissions of data can still always be kept private as was the case before.
        </div>

        <h4 class="subtitle is-4">Automatically conversion of NWB data to Brain-Score benchmarks</h4>
        <div class="content">
            While the 2.0 plugin system attempts to facilitate the process of benchmark creation,
            packaging data into a Brain-Score benchmark still represents a considerable time investment.
            We aim both to significantly reduce this burden and to encourage the adoption of standards
            for neurophysiology data by enabling automatic conversion of appropriate data that adheres
            to the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) standard into Brain-Score benchmarks.
