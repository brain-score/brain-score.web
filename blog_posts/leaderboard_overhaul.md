# Overhauling the Brain-Score Leaderboard

## Introduction

Brain-Score serves as the premier benchmarking platform for evaluating how well AI models match biological neural responses and behaviors. At the heart of this scientific endeavor lies the leaderboard — a critical interface where researchers compare model performance across dozens of cognitive and neural benchmarks spanning vision and language domains.

For 8 years now, our leaderboard has faithfully ranked models, providing the essential function of scientific comparison via integrated benchmarking. However, as the platform grew to encompass hundreds of models and increasingly sophisticated benchmarks, we recognized that our community needed more than just rankings.

Researchers were asking deeper questions:

- Why do certain architectures excel?
- Where do models break down?
- Which training approaches generalize across tasks?

This realization sparked a comprehensive overhaul of our leaderboard system, transforming it from a static ranking display into a powerful exploratory tool built on AG-Grid technology.

## The Problem

Our original leaderboard excelled at its primary mission: ranking models. It provided clear, authoritative scores across benchmarks, established scientific credibility through rigorous evaluation, and served as the definitive reference for model comparison in the NeuroAI community.

However, several fundamental limitations hindered deeper scientific investigation:

- **Static Design**: The leaderboard was essentially a fixed table. The interface provided no flexibility for customized analysis or dynamic exploration of the data.
- **Difficult Comparison**: Comparing specific models or subsets required manual scanning across rows, with no ability to highlight, filter, or isolate particular models or benchmarks.
- **No Filtering Capabilities**: Researchers couldn't filter by model architectures, training datasets, parameter counts, or benchmark characteristics.
- **Fixed Aggregation**: The scoring system was rigid — no ability to customize which benchmarks contributed to aggregate scores or explore alternative weighting.
- **Limited Investigative Power**: The interface showed what performed best but offered no tools for understanding *why* certain models succeeded or failed.

## The Vision

We envisioned transforming our static display into a true exploratory tool — one that would serve not just as a ranking system, but as a scientific instrument for understanding AI model behavior. Our guiding questions included:

- How do different model architectures compare across benchmarks?
- Where do models break down, and what does this tell us about their limitations?
- Which architectural choices and training approaches generalize across tasks?
- How can researchers customize scoring to focus on benchmarks most relevant to their work?

### Our leaderboard overhaul had these core requirements:

- **Interactive Comparison and Filtering**: Filter by model properties (architecture, size, training data) and benchmark characteristics (brain region, species, task type).
- **Real-time Exploration**: Support dynamic interaction with immediate feedback.
- **Custom Scoring**: Let users include/exclude benchmarks and see how rankings change.
- **Collaborative Features**: Share filter states and annotated views via persistent URLs.
- **Citation Integration**: Link performance results to source papers.

## Architecture and Implementation

### Database Architecture: From Real-time to Pre-computed

Previously, leaderboard requests triggered expensive queries and real-time aggregation. As the data scaled, this became unsustainable. We transitioned to a **materialized view architecture** that pre-computes:

- Statistical scores (e.g., medians, relative rankings)
- Normalized values for color-coding
- Optimized model metadata for frontend delivery

This shift cut load times from several seconds to under 500ms, unlocking true interactivity.

### Progressive Loading Strategy

To eliminate long blank-page loads:

- The page loads structure and UI **immediately**
- Benchmark data loads **asynchronously** in the background
- Users can begin interacting right away
- A 7-day caching layer (with user-specific layers) ensures fast revisit times


### Client-Side Data Processing

We offloaded sorting/filtering to the browser:

- No round-trips for UI actions
- Filtering across architecture, benchmarks, and performance thresholds happens in <1s
- All logic runs on modular components, with:
  - Persistent filter state
  - Boolean logic search
  - Multi-dimensional filter coordination

### Hierarchical Data Visualization

Brain-Score benchmarks exist in a **hierarchy** (e.g., vision → object recognition → task). To support this:

- Benchmarks are shown in **expandable groups**
- Aggregate scores recalculate on the fly as users include/exclude categories
- Enables exploration of how cognitive domain choices affect rankings

### Performance at Scale

We achieved scalable performance by combining:

- Client-side logic for interaction
- Lazy rendering of benchmarks on demand
- Optimized serialization and progressive enhancement
- Support for high-performance and constrained environments alike

## Scientific Impact and Community Use


This overhaul enables:

- **New Research Questions**: Compare transformers vs CNNs on specific tasks.
- **Meta-Analysis**: Export and analyze trends across training dataset, size, or architecture.
- **Benchmark Development**: Help benchmark authors identify which model features predict performance.
- **Scientific Discovery**: Reduce data wrangling. Increase scientific insight.

The leaderboard is now more than a ranking tool — it's a **discovery platform** for AI-brain alignment research.

## Future Directions


Our roadmap includes:

- **Advanced Analytics**: Built-in statistical tools for correlation, significance, etc.
- **Predictive Insights**: Suggest benchmarks or models of interest using ML.
- **Enhanced Visualization**: Interactive plots, not just tables.
- **Real-Time Inference**: Connect directly to compute resources to run inference.

This isn’t just a UI upgrade — it’s a reflection of our deeper goal: giving the NeuroAI community the tools it needs to understand what makes models brain-like.

## Conclusion

The Brain-Score leaderboard overhaul demonstrates how thoughtful engineering can accelerate scientific discovery. By transforming a static ranking system into an interactive exploration platform, we've:

- Improved the user experience
- Enabled hypothesis-driven investigation
- Supported meta-analysis
- Exposed meaningful performance patterns

Most importantly, we've lowered the friction between research questions and answers — and moved one step closer to bridging the gap between artificial and biological intelligence.
