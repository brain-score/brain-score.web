Brain-Score
===========

Brain-Score is a collection of benchmarks and models:
benchmarks combine neural/behavioral data with a metric to score models on their alignment to experimental observations,
and models are evaluated as computational hypotheses of natural intelligence.

This site serves as the central documentation for `brain-score.web <https://github.com/brain-score/brain-score.web>`_,
a repo that controls the Brain-Score `website <https://www.brain-score.org>`_, both front and back end.
